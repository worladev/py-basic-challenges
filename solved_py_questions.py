(use three separate input state-ments).
Create variables called total and average that hold the sum and average of the
three numbers and print out the values of total and average.	
'''
num1 = int(input("\nEnter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

total  = num1 + num2 + num3
average = total/3

print(f"Total: {total}")
print(f"Average: {average}")

- A lot of cell phones have tip calculators. Write one. Ask the user for the price
of the meal and the percent tip they want to leave. Then print both the tip amount
and the total bill with the tip included.
'''
price = int(input("\nEnter food price: "))
percent_tip = int(input("Enter percent of tip you want to leave: "))

tip = (percent_tip/price) * 100
total_bill = price + tip

print(f"Tip amount: ${tip}")
print(f"Total bill: ${total_bill}")
